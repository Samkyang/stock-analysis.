# Challenge 02: Stock-Analysis

## 1. Overview of Project

#### The overview of this project was to help Steve research certain stocks from 2017 and 2018 so that he can provide feedback to his parents. It was also to learn how to refract somebody elses code to make it run more efficient as well as how to leverage code I already wrote from going through this weeks reading.

### How It Was Done

#### I created a macro that would scan the stock lists from 2018 and 2017. The macro would take the user input and output the ticker symbol, total daily volume for the given year and the annual return. 

#### When reviewing the macro from _*Download challenge_starter_code.vbs*_ I reviewed the provided macro and challenge requirements and saw that it would be fairly similar to the what I had just completed in the reading.
